Postmarkapp is a "email delivery in the cloud" service for sending out transactional emails in your applications. By using this service you don't need to worry about the setup and maintenance of a mailserver and as Postmarkapp is built to scale it can easily deal with large bursts of messages. Whilst an easy-to-use API is available this Zend_Mail transport allows you to easily switch out and use Postmark for mail delivery.

Usage is as simple as:

<?php

$options = array(
    'From'     => 'Alistair Phillips <your-email-address>',
    'To'       => 'Alistair Phillips <some-other-address>',
    'Subject'  => 'Test',
    'TextBody' => 'hello there',
    'HtmlBody' => '<b>hello</b>'
);

$postmark = new Postmark_Services_PostmarkApp('Your API Key');

if ($postmark->send()) {
    $message = 'your email was sent successfully';
};




// OR




$postmark  = new Services_PostmarkApp('Your API Key');
$transport = new Postmark_Mail_Transport_Postmark($postmark)

Zend_Mail::setDefaultTransport($transport);

$mail = new Zend_Mail();
$mail->setFrom('your-email-address', 'Alistair Phillips');
$mail->setReplyTo('some-other-address', 'Alistair Phillips');
$mail->addTo('an-email-address', 'Joe Smith' );
$mail->setSubject( 'Welcome to...' );
$mail->setBodyText( 'This is an example of a text body' );
$mail->setBodyHtml( 'This is an example of an HTML body with <b>bold</b>' );

$mail->send();

?>

One call to setDefaultTransport() and you're now using the cloud for delivery. Added support for attachments to the class.

Alternatively, you can use our application resource.
In your application/config/application.ini, add these lines:

    ; This makes sure that your Zend Framework application can find the correct
    ; resource file. Make sure, the Postmark folder is within your library folder.
    pluginPaths.Postmark_Application_Resource = "Postmark/Application/Resource"

    ; This initializes the Postmark drop-in replacement.
    resources.postmark.apikey = "your_api_key"

Now you're good to go and don't have to manually do anything else.
